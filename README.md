### Abstract
We propose a smartphone-mountable computational microscope that achieves wide-field and high-resolution imaging, based on Fourier Ptychographic (FP) microscopy technique. Our device utilizes the built-in camera in the smartphone for microscopy imaging, the display screen for programmable illumination, and the computational power of the smartphone processors for FP image reconstruction. With a compact and light-weight optics module and a custom-built application, we can turn a regular smartphone into a high-performance microscope device with the space-bandwidth-product exceeding that of regular benchtop microscopes. Our device achieves a half-pitch resolution of 870 nm over a wide field-of-view of 2.1 mm Ã— 1.6 mm, with amplitude, phase, and color imaging capabilities. We report on the design of the illumination and the imaging system, our methods for fast FP reconstruction on our smartphone microscope, and the performance of the device. With various clinical samples, we also discuss the potential of our device for clinical applications in resource-limited settings.
